// My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.
//
//     I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.
//
//     For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.
//

// When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:
//
//     180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.
//
const customSort = (a: number[], b: number[]) => a[0] === b[0] ? a[2].toString().localeCompare(b[2].toString()) : a[0] - b[0];
import {describe, expect, it, test} from "vitest";


//     All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

};
